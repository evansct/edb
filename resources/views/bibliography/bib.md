--good plant info. that is relatively detailed

--only copy known of this memoir is a transcript bound with other narratives of
 
discovery, exploration and trade, bound and in the library of a Swiss gentleman from the second third of the 18th century. Pease got it from the Newberry Library of Chicago
--the signature “Degannes” is not easily explained, but what the author tells of himself and experiences in the Illinois country points unmistakably to Sieur Deliette, nephew of Henri de Tonti
Deliette says that “This nation [the Illinois], as well as the Miami, has no religion.” (p.
363), then goes on to describe how a number of animals are considered manitous, or spirits. This statement is important as it sheds light on the biases and potential inaccuracies of the author’s observations. If he couldn’t see that they had some sort of religion, then what else did he not see, or record accurately?
Deliette also expressed strong disbelief in the knowledge of the medicine men, stating, “Most often they do not cure the sick, although assuredly they have admirable drugs, because they are ignorant of internal maladies. It is only a mere chance when they succeed.” (Pease 1934:367, Deliette). And in the same paragraph says, “In the healing of wounds some of them are very skillful.” So he did not think they knew what they were doing when it came to internal maladies and their knowledge of how plants could help cure these specific internal diseases, but did believe they had knowledge and skills in curing external diseases.

--p73—dogbane reference regarding Iroquois territory

Thwaites, Reuben Gold, editor. 1966 (reprint after his death, from 1900 translation/edition by Thwaites). Voyages of Marquette in The Jesuit Relations, 59. [by Jacques Marquette with French and English text]. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms, Inc.
--the same info. published under another title: “Travels and explorations of the Jesuit missionaries in New France, 1610-1791: The original french, latin, and italian texts, with english translation and notes; illustrated by portraits, maps, and facsimiles” The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents
--travels and explorations of Pére Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary
--part of the Jolliet-Marquette expedition of 1673, descending the Mississippi River almost to its joining with the Arkansas River, then returning
--established that Miss.R. emptied into Gulf of Mex, instead of Gulf of Calif., which was impt. info. for the French and Spanish govts.
--primary purpose of Marquette on trip was to save souls
--more recently, there has been controversy that Marquette’s writings were actually done by Jolliet then rewritten to appear as Marquette’s.
--first published in 1681 by Thevenot, in Recueil de voyages
** the impt. point for my work is to be careful not to treat any Jolliet references as completely separate from Marquette’s.

Thwaites, Reuben Gold, editor. 1903. A new discovery of a vast country in America, by Father Louis Hennepin. Reprinted from the second London issue of 1698. Chicago: A. C. McClurg & Co.
--two volumes:
vol. I. pp. 1-356: Hennepin’s writings
vol. II pp. 357-673: Marquette, LaSalle, Joliet
--Thwaites added an introduction, and a biographical sketch by another author
--Father Hennepin was a missionary from Belgium, French his native language, but also knew other languages, including English
--he arrived in Quebec in 1675
--he knew and traveled with LaSalle, spending four years in Canada
 
--he moved to another area, which is now Kingston, Ontario
--he tried to take credit for his ship-mate, La Salle’s explorations, at times
--in Nov. 1679, Hennepin went down “River of Miamis”, the St. Joseph (p135)
--long discussion of the buffalo hunt and use
--he allegedly did not voyage down the lower Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
Father Membre, of La Salle’s journey from Fort Crevecoeur to the mouth of the Miss. R. (1682), wrote an account of this journey which was suppressed.
Hennepin appropriated it and made it appear that it was his own journey of 1680. With this added journey he could claim to have journeyed the entire course of the Miss. R.
--the reprint that was used in my thesis was from an English version, presumably done by Hennepin himself, so Thwaites is reprinting this, and not doing the
translating—original in English
--the original French version of Hennepin’s journey of the upper Miss. and Illinois R. is titled “A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America extending above four thousand miles, between New France and new Mexico, with a description of the Great Lakes, Cataracts, Rivers, Plants and Anaimals. Also, the manners, customs, and languages of the several Naïve Indians; and the Advantage of Commerce with those different Nations. Original in English then translated into French, etc.
--“Had Hennepin, however, been content with being a one-volume author, his reputation might still be as good as that of most other explorers of his day. . . The pages of our adventurous friar abound in exaggeration and self-glorification; although his geographical and ethnographical descriptions are excellent, and add much to our knowledge of the North American interior during the last third of the seventeenth century. But in 1697, encouraged by his first success, he brought forth at Utrecht another book—Nouvelle Decouverte d’un tres grad Pays, situe dans l’Amerique. This omits the description of the life and manners among the Indians, which was perhaps the strongest feature of Louisiane. The volume appears to have leaped into popularity . . . one of the most widely read books of its day (Thwaites 1903:xxxiii, regarding Hennepin).
